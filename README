Hello,
This is EE's Misaka Mikoto mod.
This is a mod designed to replace Storm Spirit in Dota 2.
Updates to things like animations and particles and vo sounds to come. 
Thank you!

This is still in early release. There are still things to be done.

HOW TO INSTALL:
1. Download: https://github.com/eedisciple/misakaMikotoEE/archive/master.zip
2. Run dota.exe and extract all files to the following directory: <Path to steam directory>\Steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\dota
3. Right click Dota 2 in steam, click 'Properties' and on the General tab click LAUNCH OPTIONS
4. In the text field in the LAUNCH OPTIONS window type:   -override_vpk
5. Launch DOTA 2. Storm Spirit is renamed to Biribiri, so remember to look in the B's for her, not the S's. Or click CTRL and click her icon to pick her.

HOW TO UNINSTALL:
Either wait until I make a batch script or delete all the files you extracted manually.

FAQ:
Q: Can I get banned?
A: No.
Q: Why isn't she Zeus?
A: read the complaint

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me somehow.
Thanks~
